Hello all!

1. This is a group project of the DBMS Course (CS260) of our semester in IIT PATNA. We have made the training and placement portal of IITP which combines three domains, viz. for Students, Alumni, and Recruiters.

2. The front end is mainly coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and also contains some Bootstrap. It has a clean and clear UI that enables every type of user, i.e student, alumni or recruiter, to browse through the website in a hassle-free manner.

3. Backend of the website consists of PHP in such a way that it connects the user to the database server through MYSQL.

4. It has various features such as:
   
   (i)Students can check for eligible companies according to their skills and company requirements.
   
   (ii) Als,o companies can select and filter out students according to their requirements and job roles.
   
   (iii) It also contains an alumni section where alumni's can provide their current and past job journey along with their other details like(company name, CTC, location, etc.).
   
   (iv)Functionalities let users interact with the database. User-specific interaction induced. Only selected users
		like admin has special privileges, others have limited scope for smoother control and functioning.
